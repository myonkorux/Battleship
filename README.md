# Battleship
The Battleship Simulation project 

Created Spring Semester 2014 for Intro to Engineering using MATLAB

Project required GUI interface and a modeling aspect.

The project simulates a user-specified amount of Battleship games between two computers
in order to determine which among three self-designed algorithms for winning Battleship
is the most efficient.
